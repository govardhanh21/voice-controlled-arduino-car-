Voice Controlled Arduino Car
📌 Overview
This project is a voice-controlled robotic car that uses a mobile application to receive speech commands and control movement in real time via Bluetooth communication.

🚀 Features
Voice-based control using mobile app
Wireless communication via Bluetooth (HC-05)
Directional movement: forward, backward, left, right, stop
Real-time response to commands
Simple and user-friendly control system
🛠️ Tech Stack
Arduino Uno
Embedded C / Arduino IDE
Communication: HC-05 Bluetooth Module
Hardware: Motors, Motor Driver (L298N), Chassis, Wheels
Mobile App: Dabble
⚙️ Working
The system uses the Dabble mobile application to convert voice commands into Bluetooth signals. These signals are transmitted via the HC-05 module to the Arduino. The Arduino processes the received commands and controls the motors accordingly to perform directional movements.

▶️ How to Run
Upload the code to Arduino
Connect the HC-05 Bluetooth module
Pair the mobile device with HC-05
Open the Dabble app and use voice control
Give commands like “forward”, “left”, “right”, “back”
📌 Future Improvements
Speed control using voice commands
Obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensor
Camera integration for live monitoring
